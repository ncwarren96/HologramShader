Video demo of shader running in Kleptonaut here: https://drive.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/file/d/1GttP-hSGCvgqsROmK1MixxrhKwGfvU3u/view?usp=sharing



Note: The 170 game Kleptonaut has not been in targeted development for web, so the game is actually unplayable with a web build. Therefore we opted to show a running web build of a simple primitives to show the shaders running, and then took a short video of how they look in Kleptonaut.
